# Hotel Management System in Python

This Python project implements a simple hotel management system, providing functionalities for room booking, calculating room rent, ordering food from the restaurant, calculating restaurant bills, and displaying the total cost.

## Overview

This hotel management system consists of the following classes:

- **Customer**: Represents a customer with attributes like name, address, and room number. It allows inputting customer data.

- **Room**: Manages room-related functionalities such as different room types, their rates, inputting room type and duration of stay, and calculating room rent.

- **Restaurant**: Handles restaurant operations including displaying the menu, taking food orders, and calculating food bills.

- **TotalBill**: Combines functionalities from Customer, Room, and Restaurant to calculate the total bill including room rent, food bill, and extra charges.

## Usage

To use the hotel management system, run the `main()` function in the script. It presents a menu-driven interface where users can choose various options such as booking a room, calculating room rent, ordering food, calculating restaurant bills, displaying total cost, showing booked rooms, and exiting the program.
